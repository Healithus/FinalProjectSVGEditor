# FinalProjectSVGEditor
## Overview
This software is Final Project for course CS321, a simple editor in SVG file format. It can draw a total of 5 different patterns (ellipse, circle, rectangle, square and line). The code corresponding to the SVG file can be seen in real-time while the pattern is being generated. The editor supports exporting to four different formats, including SVG files, PNG files, PDF files and JEPG files, and supports re-importing existing SVG files. In addition to these, the editor also supports saving the current job state and reloading the job state to the editor when the user needs it. File save detection is also implemented in the editor, when the user closes or accidentally closes the window, the editor will detect whether the user has saved or not and alert the user, allowing the user to decide whether to continue to close the editor.
